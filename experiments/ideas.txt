PopcornQuizz
    - quizz about movies, multiple modes (timed/tries and poster/frame)
    - an image of the movie (the poster or a still frame) is displayed very heavilypixelated
    - users must guess the title of the movie
    - timed mode: users get 30s, every second the movie gets less pixelated (pixels become smaller), infinite tries
    - tries mode: users get 5 tries, every try the movie gets less pixelated (pixels become smaller), infinite time
    - use an opensource API to get list of 100+ top most famous movies titles and posters (and stillframes if possible)

Language & Meaning (but not just guessing words)
    Synonym Ladder
        - Guess a target word by submitting synonyms. Feedback shows semantic closeness (not letters).
        - Example: “angry” → 🔥🔥🔥, “furious” → 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
    Definitionle
        - You’re given a cryptic dictionary-style definition and must guess the word in 6 tries.
    False Friend
        - Guess the correct meaning of a word that looks familiar but is misleading (great for language learners).
    Word Family
        - The target word belongs to a hidden family (prefix/root/suffix). Guesses reveal whether roots match.

Logic-Based Variants
    Patternlock
        - Guess a hidden pattern (e.g., ABAAB, ABCDE). Letters don’t matter, only repetition structure.
    Constraintle
        - Each guess adds a new rule (e.g., “must contain exactly 2 vowels”). You must deduce the final word.
    Binaryle
        - Target is a 6-bit binary number. Guesses give feedback on bit position correctness.

Sound & Phonetics
    Phonemle
        - Guess a word by phonemes instead of letters. Feedback is based on sound similarity.
    Rhymle
        - You must guess a word that perfectly rhymes with the target. Feedback shows syllable and stress match.

Visual / Spatial (still text-light)
    Glyph Guess
        - Each guess reveals a stylized glyph representing letter shapes or symmetry, not the letters themselves.
    Directionle
        - Guess a path (↑ ↓ ← →). Correct directions and positions are highlighted like Wordle letters.

Numbers & Sequences
    Seqle
        - Guess the next number in a hidden sequence. Each wrong guess reveals a property (arithmetic, geometric, etc.).
    Statle
        - Guess a hidden statistical summary (mean, median, max). Guesses reveal distance from correct values.

Knowledge-Light Trivia Hybrids
    Yearle (but smarter)
        - Guess a year tied to an event. Feedback shows before/after and historical closeness.
    Orderle
        - Guess the correct order of 5 items (e.g., inventions, sizes, ages). Feedback highlights correct positions.

Emotional / Subjective (surprisingly unexplored)
    Vibele
        - Guess a word that matches a mood descriptor (e.g., “cozy,” “ominous”). Feedback is crowd-sourced similarity.
    Intensity
        - Guess a word on a scale (warm → hot → scorching). Feedback shows relative intensity.

Ultra-Minimal Experiments
    Yes/No
        - You can only ask yes/no questions. The goal is to identify a secret word in under 10 questions.
    One Hint
        - You get exactly one cryptic hint. One guess only. Daily challenge.
    Reverse Wordle
        - The game gives feedback first, and you must find a word that would produce it.
