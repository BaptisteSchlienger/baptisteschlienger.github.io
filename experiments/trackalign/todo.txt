Note:
for development and debugging purposes, always use the sample file (clean_tracks_sample.json).

Context:
clean_tracks_sample.json contains a list of race tracks with Open Street Map GPS polyline 
as well as image pixel coordinate polyline of the track and features on the track (start/finish line, pitlane, pit entry/exit)
the images that gave these features are stored in /assets/tracks/ (but they are labeled under Results_v2/Results/ in the file).

Goal:
Create a tool that displays the GPS polyline on OSM and the image polyline on top. 
The user will use multiple controls to drag/zoom/stretch the image polyline to line it up with the OSM track.
The goal is to create a formula for each track to translate the image coordinates to GPS coordinates, 
in order to then get the GPS coordinates of the different image features (sf line, pitlane, pitlane entry/exit, turns and straight line name ...etc)
Also let the user be able to correct the following:
 - the text of the turns and straight line name
 - the coordinates of the image features (sf line, pitlane entry/exit)
 - the pitlane polyline (show the points and let the user move/remove/add them)

then add an export button to allow the user to export the completed json object
also add a way to let the user select which track he wishes to align/edit.

Note:
tracks are grouped together under the "venue" name, because the same track can have multiple different layouts. 
So when one track in the venue is aligned we can use the same alignement formula to automatically align the rest of the track layouts in that same venue.
Still let the user have the option to verify and validate the placement of the image features.
